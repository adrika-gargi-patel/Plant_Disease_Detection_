Plant Disease Detection
DESCRIPTION:
The Plant Disease Detection is a web application designed for people (especially farmers, researchers, etc). We have also trained our dataset on various deep learning models (AlexNet , InceptionV3 , VGG16 ). But at the end we have created our own CNN model. Getting affected by a disease is very common in plants due to various factors such as fertilizers, cultural practices followed, environmental conditions, etc. These diseases hurt agricultural yield and eventually the economy based on it. 
Any technique or method to overcome this problem and getting a warning before the plants are infected would aid farmers to efficiently cultivate crops or plants, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Thus, disease detection in plants plays a very important role in agriculture.

2 . In a Web Browser write the url for the webpage
3 . Webpage will be loaded
4 . Upload the image and click on predict button

HOW IT WORKS ?
The Plant Disease Detection has a straight forward process for detecting the disease. People especially farmers can easily go to the web page, they can upload the image from their device and it will predict whether the plant is healthy or unhealthy, if unhealthy then what type of disease it has. This web page is simple to use.
